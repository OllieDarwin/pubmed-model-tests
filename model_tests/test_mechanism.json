    "abstract": "Selinexor is a selective inhibitor of nuclear export (SINE) compound that blocks XPO1/CRM1. This prevents nuclear export of tumor suppressor proteins including p53, p21, IκB, and FOXO. Nuclear retention of p53 activates transcription of pro-apoptotic genes BAX, PUMA, and NOXA. In multiple myeloma cells, selinexor caused caspase-3 activation and apoptosis through restored tumor suppressor function.",

    "pathway": "Hedgehog",
    "abstract": "Vismodegib is a Smoothened (SMO) antagonist that blocks Hedgehog pathway activation. By binding SMO, vismodegib prevents its activation and blocks signal transduction to GLI transcription factors. GLI proteins remain in their repressor forms, preventing transcription of Hedgehog target genes including GLI1, PTCH1, and CCND1. In basal cell carcinoma, vismodegib reduced GLI1 expression by >95% and caused tumor regression.",

    "abstract": "Curcumin inhibits NF-κB-mediated inflammatory signaling through multiple mechanisms. The compound prevents IKK activation and IκBα phosphorylation, blocking NF-κB nuclear translocation. Curcumin also inhibits COX-2 and iNOS enzyme activities directly. In macrophages, curcumin reduced LPS-induced TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 production by >70%. This broad anti-inflammatory activity underlies curcumin's therapeutic potential.",

    "abstract": "Resveratrol activates SIRT1 deacetylase, which deacetylates p53 at Lys382 and reduces its transcriptional activity. This suppresses p53-mediated senescence induction. SIRT1 also deacetylates FOXO transcription factors, promoting expression of antioxidant genes that reduce oxidative stress-induced senescence. In fibroblasts, resveratrol extended replicative lifespan by 30% and reduced senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity by 50%.",
