    "pathway": "HER2 signaling",
    "abstract": "Trastuzumab is a monoclonal antibody that specifically targets the HER2 receptor. By binding to the extracellular domain of HER2, trastuzumab prevents receptor dimerization and inhibits downstream PI3K/AKT and MAPK signaling pathways. In HER2-positive breast cancer cells, treatment with trastuzumab resulted in significant reduction of phosphorylated AKT and ERK1/2, demonstrating effective blockade of HER2-mediated oncogenic signaling.",

The drug binds to the ATP-binding site of mutant BRAF kinase, preventing its catalytic activity. Western blot analysis demonstrated that vemurafenib treatment resulted in dose-dependent decrease in phospho-MEK and phospho-ERK levels, confirming inhibition of MAPK pathway signaling in melanoma cell lines harboring BRAF V600E mutation.",

By blocking the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands PD-L1/PD-L2, pembrolizumab prevents the inhibitory signal that suppresses T cell activation. Flow cytometry analysis showed that pembrolizumab treatment restored T cell proliferation and cytokine production (IFN-γ, TNF-α) in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, demonstrating reversal of PD-1-mediated immune suppression.",

In chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells, imatinib treatment inhibited BCR-ABL autophosphorylation and prevented phosphorylation of downstream substrates including STAT5 and CrkL.

By sequestering VEGF-A, bevacizumab prevents its binding to VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 receptors on endothelial cells.

The drug works primarily by activating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in hepatocytes, which reduces hepatic glucose production.

A retrospective cohort study of 50,000 patients found that daily aspirin use was associated with 25% reduction in myocardial infarction and stroke incidence over 10-year follow-up. The cardioprotective effects are attributed to irreversible inhibition of platelet cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1), reducing thromboxane A2 production and platelet aggregation.",
