    "pathway": "Estrogen Signaling",
    "abstract": "Anastrozole is a non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor that blocks conversion of androgens to estrogens. By inhibiting CYP19A1 (aromatase), anastrozole reduces circulating estradiol levels in postmenopausal women. This decreases ER activation and ER-mediated transcription in ER-positive breast cancer cells. Clinical trials demonstrated anastrozole superiority over tamoxifen in postmenopausal breast cancer, with reduced estradiol levels correlating with treatment response.",

    "abstract": "Abiraterone is a CYP17A1 inhibitor that blocks androgen biosynthesis at multiple tissue sites including testes, adrenals, and tumor. By inhibiting 17α-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase activities, abiraterone prevents conversion of pregnenolone to DHEA and androstenedione to testosterone. In castration-resistant prostate cancer, abiraterone reduced intratumoral androgens and AR transcriptional activity, decreasing PSA and AR target gene expression.",

Unlike first-generation antiandrogens, enzalutamide prevents AR nuclear translocation and DNA binding. In prostate cancer cells, enzalutamide blocked AR-mediated transcription of target genes including KLK3 (PSA), TMPRSS2, and FKBP5. ChIP-seq confirmed loss of AR binding to enhancer regions following treatment.",

This keeps GLI transcription factors in their repressor forms and prevents transcription of Hedgehog target genes including GLI1, PTCH1, and HHIP. In BCC tumors, vismodegib reduced GLI1 expression by >90% and caused tumor regression.",

The compound prevents IκBα phosphorylation and degradation, blocking NF-κB nuclear translocation. In cancer cell lines, curcumin reduced nuclear p65 levels and NF-κB DNA-binding activity. This decreased expression of NF-κB target genes involved in inflammation, proliferation, and survival including COX-2, IL-6, and BCL-2.",

SIRT1 deacetylates autophagy proteins including ATG5, ATG7, and LC3, enhancing their function. Resveratrol also activates AMPK, which phosphorylates ULK1 and promotes autophagy initiation.
